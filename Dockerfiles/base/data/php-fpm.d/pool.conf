; The number of child processes is set dynamically based on the following directives:
; pm.max_children, pm.start_servers, pm.min_spare_servers, pm.max_spare_servers.
pm = dynamic

; The maximum number of child processes to be created
pm.max_children = 50

; The number of child processes created on startup. Used only when pm is set to dynamic.
; Default Value: min_spare_servers + (max_spare_servers - min_spare_servers) / 2.
pm.start_servers = 10

; The desired minimum number of idle server processes.
pm.min_spare_servers = 5

; The desired maximum number of idle server processes.
pm.max_spare_servers = 15

; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.
; This can be useful to work around memory leaks in 3rd party libraries.
; For endless request processing specify '0'. Equivalent to PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS.
; Default value: 0.
pm.max_requests = 500
