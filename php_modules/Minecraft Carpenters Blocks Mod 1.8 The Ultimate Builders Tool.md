To remove a texture, right-click it with the Carpenter's Hammer. To change the shape or size of a block, left-click it with the Carpenter's Hammer or the Carpenter's Chisel. To rotate, flip, or mirror a block, sneak and right-click it with the Carpenter's Hammer. To add special effects to a block, sneak and right-click it with the corresponding item. For example, to make a block glow, sneak and right-click it with a torch.
 
You can also use the Carpenters Blocks to create hidden doors and secret passages. To do this, you need to use the Carpenters Barrier and the Carpenters Collapsible Block. The Carpenters Barrier is a block that looks like a fence or a gate, but can be opened and closed with redstone.
